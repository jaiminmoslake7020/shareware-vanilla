# Welcome to SSN Validator web app for Shareware!

Hi! I have build this app for tech challenge provided by ShareWare.

This app takes user input and it validates against suggested rules in document to provide user input  SSN is valid or not.

This one is developed with TypeScript, WebPack, Babel, TailwindCSS and Html. This solution does not use any framework but only uses simple TypeScript. One can check codebase inside app folder where index.js is entry point.

I have put efforts so my skills with building tools such as webpack and babel, and knowledge of TS/JS can be visible. As well as my UX with CSS handling can be viewed in this demo project.
